# Base system rc.conf file. Do not edit this file to change settings on YOUR
# device, instead use /usr/local/etc/init.android/rc.conf!
#
# This file mostly serves as documentation for what you can put in that file.
#

clean_tmpdir=enter
# If set to enter: rm -rf /tmp/* on rc.enter
# If set to leave: rm -rf /tmp/* on rc.leave
# If set to anything else: rm -rf /tmp/* on rc.enter AND rc.leave
# If unset: /tmp is untouched.
# If clean_tmpdir_filters is set: delegate to clean_tmpdir_filters to decide
# what to delete/keep.

clean_tmpdir_filters=
# 
# Space delimited list of scripts to run with busybox.
#
# Each script will be called in the order listed by rc.enter and rc.leave, IAW
# with the $clean_tmpdir variable.
#
# It will be called like this:
#
# 	cd $LINUX_CHROOT; ls ./tmp | busybox sh yourscript
#
# The script will have the following environment variables set:
#
# 	LINUX_CHROOT = where the chroot is.
# 	PWD          = the chroot's /, which really is the cwd!
#
# Also each variable in the rc.conf system will be exported.
#

#hostname=
# If set: value will be stored in /etc/hostname.

#resolv_map=
# Set if you want to do resolv.conf mappings, see below.
# default is to rely on getprop on net.dns*

resolv_iface=wlan0
# What interface to do mappings on.

#resolv_mappings=
# What networks to do resolv.conf mappings on.
#
# Space delimited list like resolv_mappings='192.168.1 192.168.2'.
# This loads resolv.conf from /usr/local/etc/resolv.d/192.168.2.conf when
# resolv_iface has an IP of 192.168.2.xxx
#

ipv4_forwarding=
# enables IP(v4) forwarding if set.

enter_services='ssh'
# What services to start on rc.enter
#
# Space delimited list of names from /etc/init.d/
#

leave_services=
# What services to stop on rc.leave
#
# Space delimited list of names from /etc/init.d/
#

leave_linux_dirs=yes
# If set: Linux directories like /proc will remain bound when leaving the chroot.
# If unset: they get unbound.
# Unsetting this may cause havoc on daemons left alive when leaving the chroot.
#
# Leaving it set will cause device busy errors when usng external storage for
# the chroot, and trying to umount said external storage. This is more an issue
# for tablets like the ASUS Transformer series. Suggested work around is to
# call etc/init.android/L95.Linux _after_ ensuring leave_linux_dirs and
# LINUX_CHROOT_RCDIR are set correctly. You could also copy/paste part that
# into your etc/usr/local/rc.leave script or something. You're smart, figure it
# out.

android_dirs=
# If set: it will be treated as a space delimited list of dirs in the Android /
# to bind within the chroot.
#
# The default is not to mount any Android directories. If you wish to however,
# the suggested value for most devices is:
#
# 	android_dirs='/mnt/sdcard /data /system'
#

#leave_android_dirs=
# If set: Android directories like /data will remain bound when leaving the chroot.
# If unset: they get unbound.
#
# !ATTENTION!
#
# This is unset by default, because rm -rf $LINUX_CHROOT could be _bad_ if
# /stuff was bound to $LINUX_CHROOT/stuff. It is assumed you know what you are
# doing and that you are aware that NO WARRENTY is provided either way. 
#
# Comment about leave_linux_dirs=true and using external storage, also applies here.
#

ldconfig=yes
# run ldconfig to make sure that library search paths are up to snuff.  this
# may take a while if you've a megaton but it's very helpful if you ever
# install stuff without apt/dpkg. Like using /usr/local for self compiled libs.
