# Base system rc.conf file. Do not edit this file to change settings on YOUR
# device, instead use /usr/local/etc/init.android/rc.conf!
#
# This file mostly serves as documentation for what you can put in that file.
#

clean_tmpdir=enter
# If set to enter: rm -rf /tmp/* on rc.enter
# If set to leave: rm -rf /tmp/* on rc.leave
# If set to anything else: rm -rf /tmp/* on rc.enter AND rc.leave
# If unset: /tmp is untouched.

#hostname=
# If set: value will be stored in /etc/hostname.

#resolv_map=
# Set if you want to do resolv.conf mappings, see below.
# default is to rely on getprop on net.dns*

resolv_iface=wlan0
# What interface to do mappings on.

#resolv_mappings=
# What networks to do resolv.conf mappings on.
#
# Space delimited list like resolv_mappings='192.168.1 192.168.2'.
# This loads resolv.conf from /usr/local/etc/resolv.d/192.168.2.conf when
# resolv_iface has an IP of 192.168.2.xxx
#

ipv4_forwarding=
# enables IP(v4) forwarding if set.

enter_services='ssh'
# What services to start on rc.enter
#
# Space delimited list of names from /etc/init.d/
#

leave_services=
# What services to stop on rc.leave
#
# Space delimited list of names from /etc/init.d/
#

leave_linux_dirs=yes
# If set: Linux directories like /proc will remain bound when leaving the chroot.
# If unset: they get unbound.
# Unsetting this may cause havoc on daemons left alive when leaving the chroot.

android_dirs=
# If set: it will be treated as a space delimited list of dirs in the Android /
# to bind within the chroot.
#
# The default is not to mount any Android directories. If you wish to however,
# the suggested value for most devices is:
#
# 	android_dirs='/mnt/sdcard /data /system'
#

#leave_android_dirs=
# If set: Android directories like /data will remain bound when leaving the chroot.
# If unset: they get unbound.
#
# !ATTENTION!
#
# This is unset by default, because rm -rf $LINUX_CHROOT could be _bad_ if
# /stuff was bound to $LINUX_CHROOT/stuff. It is assumed you know what you are
# doing and that you are aware that NO WARRENTY is provided either way.
