installer needs to 

	be able to install busybox.
	download/unpack debian.
	set etc/hostname if a hostname is given.
	be nice to have centos style package groups available to quickly apt-get.

README

	update to note which scripts must return 0 = success != 0 = abort.
	update to note how rc.conf/script changes from within the chroot fit into exiting.

TODO
	How do we turn on IPv6 forwarding?
	Mounting stuff and mtab management
		ln -s /proc/mounts -> /etc/mtab on an rc.conf switch
	fstab?
	should local rc.leave run before system rc.leave?
	resolv.conf stuff should use resolvmap for dynamic stuff too
