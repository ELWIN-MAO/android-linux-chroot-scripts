This is a set of scripts designed for using a Linux chroot on Android.

## ROAD MAP ##

install.sh
: installs a Linux chroot on your Android device. See INSTALL file.

linuxchroot.sh
: chroot's you 

etc/init.android/rc.enter
: Base system script ran when entering the chroot.

usr/local/etc/init.android/rc.enter
: Local system script ran when entering the chroot.

etc/init.android/rc.leave
: Base system script ran when leaving the chroot.

usr/local/etc/init.android/rc.leave
: Local system script ran when leaving the chroot.

etc/init.android/rc.conf
: Base system configuration file.

usr/local/etc/init.android/rc.conf
: Local system configuration, overrides anything in etc/init.android/rc.conf.

## INIT SYSTEM ##

The init system is simple, look at the end of linuxchroot.sh!

- Scripts with filenames matching E* will be run on order before entering the chroot.
- Scripts with filenames matching L* will be run in order when the chrooted shell exits and returns control back to linuxchroot.sh.

Place scripts for your local system in ${LINUX_CHROOT}/usr/local/etc/init.android.

If it applies to just about every Android device: place it in ${LINUX_CHROOT}/etc/init.android, commit it, push to GitHub, and send me a pull request explaining the changes.


The execution order is as follows:

	linuxchroot.sh ->
		etc/init.android/rc.enter ->
			etc/init.android/E*
		usr/local/etc/init.android/rc.enter ->
			usr/local/etc/init.android/E*
		chroot $LINUX_CHROOT /bin/sh ->
			Your initial shell.
		etc/init.android/rc.leave ->
			etc/init.android/L*
		usr/local/etc/init.android/rc.leave ->
			usr/local/etc/init.android/L*
